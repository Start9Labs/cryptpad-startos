## Welcome to CryptPad

Collaboration and privacy - Yes, you can have both.

CryptPad provides a full-fledged office suite with all the tools necessary for
productive collaboration including: Rich Text, Spreadsheets, Code/Markdown,
Kanban, Slides, Whiteboard and Forms.

Users can access this over TOR or Local, but not both at the same time. TOR
performance can be slow. By default Local is selected, but you can change that
on the config page. After saving that change the service must be restarted to
take effect. NOTE: If you connected to your Embassy OS Server via TOR, when you
click Launch UI it will use the TOR link to access CryptPad (regardless of this
setting). If you connected via local, Launch UI will use the local link to
access CryptPad.

When you first connect to your self hosted CryptPad - Sign Up and create an
account. Then click on your name abbreviation in the upper right to bring up the
account menu, click profile, view my profile, then copy public key. Go back to
the Embassy Service config page and paste that key as the Admin user public key.
This will allow you to access the CryptPad admin page. There you can manage many
more configurations - including preventing any new users from signing up.
